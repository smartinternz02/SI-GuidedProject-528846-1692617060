## What is time series analysis using Bitcoin price prediction using fbprophet?

- Time series analysis is a method of studying how a variable changes over time, such as the price of Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin price prediction is a task of forecasting the future value of Bitcoin based on historical data and trends.
- fbprophet is a Python library developed by Facebook that makes it easy to build and evaluate time series forecasting models. It can handle seasonality, holidays, outliers, and changepoints automatically.

## How to do time series analysis using Bitcoin price prediction using fbprophet?

- To use fbprophet, you need to have a time series data of Bitcoin prices with two columns: ds (date) and y (value).
- You can get the data from various sources, such as Yahoo Finance, Coinbase, or other APIs.
- You can then create an instance of the Prophet class and fit it to the data using the fit method.
- You can then make future predictions by creating a dataframe with future dates using the make_future_dataframe method and passing it to the predict method.
- You can then plot the predictions and their components using the plot and plot_components methods.
- You can also evaluate the model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, etc.
